The system studies the user likes and requirements on basis of the users previous choices and recommends the user games that might interest the user. - The data is collected from tweets published on twitter. The system then filters and uses to train the testing data using the SVM classification model. - Then Further clustering is used to group the similar data and find the games that were similar to each other. - The system then using the clusters created of games is been recommended to the user using association rule mining. - Techniques used: GeoCoding, filtering, clustering, classification - SVM, Association rule mining. - Languages and Tools: Python, PyCharm, Twitter API.
